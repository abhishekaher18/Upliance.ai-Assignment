## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To analyze session and order data, correlate session engagement with revenue, and calculate the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). The analysis provides insights into the relationship between user engagement and revenue generation.

**Key Highlights:**
- High session engagement often correlates with higher revenue.
- Example: Alice Johnson contributed $35 across her orders, with consistent high ratings and engagement.
